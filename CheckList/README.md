# Checklist APP

## APP in GUI and using C++ 

This code is for a checklist application where the user can add items to a list and then check them off as they complete them.

The **#include** statements are used to import libraries and resources that the program needs to function properly.

The **TForm1** class is defined and initialized in the constructor function ```__fastcall TForm1::TForm1(TComponent* Owner)```.

The `AddButtonClick()` function is called when the user clicks the `"Add" button`. It first reads the text entered into the `TextEdit` component and then adds it as an item to the TextListBox component. If the TextEdit component is empty, then no item is added to the list.

The `TextListBoxItemClick()` function is called when the user clicks on an item in the list. It first retrieves the index of the clicked item and then deletes it from the TextListBox.

The code is written in **C++ and uses the FireMonkey framework, which is used to build cross-platform applications**.
